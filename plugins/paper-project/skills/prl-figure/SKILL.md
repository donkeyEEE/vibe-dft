description: >-
  Create, revise, audit, and export submission-grade scientific figures using PRL-style evidence logic in Python or R. Use for manuscript plots and multi-panel figures that must connect prerequisites, decisive signatures, validation, controls, quantitative criteria, sensitivity, and physical consequences. Preserve data integrity and journal-ready SVG/PDF/TIFF output. Also supports explicit AI-generated draft schematics through the documented OpenRouter route.

# PRL Scientific Figure — Router

This skill is split into two layers:

- A **static layer** under `static/` that holds versioned, reusable content fragments (the figure contract and default stance, plus a per-backend quick-start for Python and R).
- A **dynamic layer** (this file plus `manifest.yaml`) that detects the plotting backend and loads only the fragment needed for the current job. The large design, API, pattern, and QA material lives in on-demand references.

Do not try to apply the figure logic from memory or from this router. Always load fragments from disk as described below.

## Routing protocol

Follow these steps every time the skill is invoked.

### 0. Check for the OpenRouter AI-schematic route

If the user explicitly asks to generate a manuscript schematic, graphical abstract, mechanism diagram, concept illustration, or paper schematic with OpenRouter, GPT Image 2, an image-generation API, or similar wording, do **not** ask "Python or R?". This is a non-plotting AI-schematic route.

For this route:

1. Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml) and the `always_load` files.
2. Read [references/openrouter-image-generation.md](references/openrouter-image-generation.md).
3. Use [scripts/generate_openrouter_schematic.py](scripts/generate_openrouter_schematic.py) when the user wants a real API call or a reproducible payload.
4. Treat output as a draft schematic / graphical abstract, not as a quantitative data panel. Do not invent experimental values, author logos, institutional marks, or unsupported mechanisms.

Only continue to the Python/R backend gate for plotting, charting, data visualization, or manuscript figure assembly tasks that are not explicit OpenRouter AI image-generation requests.

### 1. Load the manifest and the core layer

Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml). It declares the `backend` axis, the allowed values, and the file paths each value maps to.

Read every exact skill-owned and plugin-shared resource listed under
`always_load`. Read shared resources from the current plugin tree on each
invocation. If an optional shared resource is unavailable or malformed, warn
and continue without substituting another resource source. A missing
skill-owned reference is a plugin packaging defect. The local
`static/core/prl-evidence-logic.md` integrates the reusable figure workflow;
individual references retain their evidence and caveats.

### 2. Resolve the backend — a blocking gate

Backend selection blocks plotting tasks, but it should not annoy the same user forever. Decide the `backend` value in this order:

1. If the current request explicitly chooses Python or R, use that backend and save it with `scripts/prl_figure_backend.py set python` or `scripts/prl_figure_backend.py set r`.
2. If the request provides a clearly language-specific input file/workflow, use that backend and save it.
3. Otherwise run `scripts/prl_figure_backend.py get`. If it returns `python` or `r`, use the saved preference.
4. If no saved preference exists, ask exactly one concise question — **Python or R? I will remember this as your default.** — and stop. After the user answers, save the answer before proceeding.

- `python` — matplotlib / seaborn.
- `r` — ggplot2 / patchwork / ComplexHeatmap.

Do not guess or choose a backend by aesthetics alone. Only recommend a backend when the user explicitly asks you to choose; then use `references/backend-selection.md`, state the reason, save the selected backend, and proceed. Once selected, the backend is **exclusive** for all drawing, previewing, exporting, and visual QA (see `core/contract.md`). This gate does not apply to the explicit OpenRouter AI-schematic route above.

### 3. Load the matching backend fragment

After the backend is resolved, Read the mapped fragment (`static/fragments/backend/python.md` or `static/fragments/backend/r.md`). It carries the backend-only execution rule and the publication quick-start (rcParams/theme and export helper). Do **not** load the other backend's fragment.

### 4. Build the figure using the loaded material

Apply the loaded material in this order:

1. Figure contract (`core/contract.md`) — write the core conclusion, map the evidence chain, classify the archetype, set the journal/export contract, before any code.
2. PRL evidence logic (`core/prl-evidence-logic.md`) — assign each panel a prerequisite, signature, validation, control, sensitivity, criterion, or consequence role.
3. Default stance (`core/stance.md`) — evidence-first composition, hero panel, restrained palette, statistics/integrity as part of the figure.
4. Backend fragment — the exclusive Python or R quick-start and execution rule.
5. Template adaptation — when reusing bundled examples or user-provided plotting code, load `references/asset-adaptation.md` before mapping data or changing the script.
6. Delivery preflight — before final delivery, load `references/qa-contract.md`, run `scripts/validate_figure.py` on the plotting source, then inspect the rendered outputs at final size.

The chart serves the scientific logic; aesthetic polish is subordinate to making the core conclusion clear, defensible, and reviewable.

### 5. Reach for references only when needed

The files under `references/` are deep references, not defaults. Open them on demand per the `references.on_demand` table in the manifest — for example `references/figure-contract.md` to build the contract, `references/asset-adaptation.md` to reuse a plotting template safely, `references/template-catalog.md` for validated Python CSV templates, `references/api.md` for the Python palette and helpers, `references/r-workflow.md` for R, `references/design-theory.md` for color/typography/export rationale, `references/common-patterns.md` and `references/chart-types.md` for layout/chart recipes, `references/nature-2026-observations.md` for real Nature page archetypes, `references/qa-contract.md` before final delivery, and `references/tutorials.md` / `references/demos.md` for worked examples.

## Why this split

- The static layer is versioned and reviewable. The backend gate is now explicit in the manifest rather than buried in prose.
- The dynamic layer keeps each invocation cheap: only the selected backend's quick-start enters context, and the 2,600+ lines of reference depth load only when a step needs them.
- The router itself is short on purpose. Update fragments and references, not this file, when adding scope.
- This structure mirrors `nature-writing`, `nature-polishing`, `nature-reader`, and `nature-paper2ppt`.
